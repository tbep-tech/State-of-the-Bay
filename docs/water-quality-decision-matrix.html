<p>Water quality in Tampa Bay has improved steadily in recent decades
due to pollution reduction projects and restoration of bay habitats.
Tampa Bay has generally met water quality standards in each bay segment,
excluding Old Tampa Bay, since 2006.</p>

<p>
</p>
<p>The water quality report card is produced annually to track status
and trends of water quality conditions in each of the four major bay
segments. This tool provides a simple “stoplight” graphic using water
quality data provided by the Environmental Protection Commission of
Hillsborough County. The report card synthesizes thousands of water
quality records to understand annual and seasonal variation in
chlorophyll concentrations and water column light attenuation.
Chlorophyll provides a measure of algae growth in the water column and
light attenuation provides a measure of potential shading from algae
growth that can limit seagrass growth. Excess nutrient pollution from
atmospheric, wastewater, and stormwater sources can cause excess algae
growth. The goal of the report card is to assess water quality trends
that may be harmful for bay habitats, including conditions that are
unfavorable for seagrass growth, to inform management activities that
support a healthy environment.</p>
<p>Tracking the attainment of bay segment specific targets for
chlorophyll and light attenuation provides the framework for developing
and initiating bay management actions. TBEP management actions adopted
in response to the annually-assessed decision support results are shown
below.</p>
<p><span style="color:#2DC938; letter-spacing: 2px"><strong>Stay the
Course</strong></span>: Continue planned projects. Report data via
annual progress reports and Baywide Environmental Monitoring Report.</p>
<p><span
style="color:#E9C318; letter-spacing: 2px"><strong>Caution</strong></span>:
Review monitoring data and nitrogen loading estimates. Begin/continue
TAC and Management Board development of specific management
recommendations.</p>
<p><span style="color:#CC3231; letter-spacing: 2px"><strong>On
Alert</strong></span>: Finalize development and implement appropriate
management actions to get back on track.</p>
<p>The management category or action is based on the combination of
annual outcomes for chlorophyll and light attenuation.</p>
