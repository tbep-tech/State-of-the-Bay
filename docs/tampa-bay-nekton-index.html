<p>The Tampa Bay Nekton Index (TBNI), which is similar to the water
quality scorecard, uses data from the State of Florida’s Fisheries
Independent Monitoring Program (FWC - FWRI) to track trends for
representative fish and invertebrate species. With samples dating back
to 1998, the long-term record can be related to water quality and
habitat characteristics to identify factors affecting health of bay
fisheries. The index evaluates catch data relative to habitat use,
species composition and diversity, and feeding dynamics to understand
trends in the fish community.</p>

</p>
<p>An annual “snapshot” of ecological health helps fisheries managers
target efforts to improve habitat or other factors. Nekton index scores
can be translated into actionable management categories with narrative
interpretations. Each action category has a description to provide
guidance to managers:</p>
<p><span style="color:#2DC938; letter-spacing: 2px"><strong>Stay the
Course</strong></span>: Continue planned projects. Report data via
annual progress reports.</p>
<p><span
style="color:#E9C318; letter-spacing: 2px"><strong>Caution</strong></span>:
Review monitoring data and identify additional research/monitoring
needs. Begin/continue TAC and Management Board development of specific
management recommendations.</p>
<p><span style="color:#CC3231; letter-spacing: 2px"><strong>On
Alert</strong></span>: Finalize development and implement appropriate
management actions to get nekton community back on track.</p>
<p>The long-term results for the nekton index suggest the fish community
is resistant to large-scale changes and resilient to episodic
disturbance. For example, “Yellow” cautionary scores were observed in
the mid-2000s and 2010/11 when red tide conditions and cold snaps may
have affected the bay fish community. Recent conditions in 2021 and 2022
suggest the fish community was likely affected by the summer red tide
observed in Tampa Bay. Long-term trends in nekton index scores by bay
segment are shown below.</p>
