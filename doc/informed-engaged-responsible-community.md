# Informed, Engaged, Responsible Community

## Behavior Change 

\#LoveTampaBay is TBEPâ€™s latest community campaign, aimed at celebrating the beauty and wonder of Tampa Bay and its watershed. Residents and visitors are encouraged to DO MORE to protect the bay, LEARN MORE about how we depend on a healthy bay, and SHARE THE LOVE by posting photos showing how Tampa Bay inspires us.

TBEP keeps the "Scoop that Poop!" campaign alive by making outreach materials available to interested campaign ambassadors upon request.

Each spring, TBEP directs its marketing efforts towards the well known Be Floridian Campaign, coinciding with the regional fertilizer ordinances. Through inbound marketing tactics, the Program works to increase the campaign's reach through its Facebook page.

Here's a change.

## Give-a-Day for the Bay

## Grants Awarded

To date, TBERF has received $6.6M in funding + $12.5M in matching funds to support 72 grants within the Tampa Bay watershed.

Since 2000, sales from the Tarpon Tag speciality license plate have collectively awarded $2M to more than 370 community-based restoration projects in the bay through TBEP's Bay Mini-Grant program

Established during the novel Coronavirus pandemic, the Digital Challenge Grant program was created to provide income opportunities for digital content creators, science communicators, graphic designers and educators.

## Reach Index

Being heard in an increasingly busy digital landscape is harder now than ever before. To elevate its message and the work of its partners, TBEP leans on social networking platforms to reach new audiences and maintain meaningful communication with its current online community. Through engagement-driven messaging, innovative mediums and frequent adaptation, the Program hopes to increase its volume, distribute important media and elevate the voices of its partners.
