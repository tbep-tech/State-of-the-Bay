Funded by sales from of the Tampa Bay Estuary Specialty License Plate, also known as the [Tarpon Tag](https://tbep.org/get-involved/tarpon-tag/){target="_parent"}, [Bay Mini-Grants](https://tbep.org/our-work/restoration-research/bay-mini-grants/){target="_parent"} provide competitive cash awards (up to \$5,000) to community organizations for projects that help restore and protect Tampa Bay. To achieve Program CCMP goals, specific Bay Mini-Grant priority actions are announced annually. Expanding the use of green infrastructure and understanding emerging contaminants have both been recent Bay Mini-Grant priorities. Since 2000, sales from the Tarpon Tag specialty license plate have collectively awarded `r bmgsum['total']` to `r bmgsum['n']` community-based restoration projects in the bay through TBEP's Bay Mini-Grant program.

Established during the COVID-19 pandemic, the [Digital Challenge Grants](https://tbep.org/our-work/restoration-research/digital-challenge-grants/){target="_parent"} program was created to provide safer-at-home income opportunities for digital content creators, science communicators, graphic designers, and educators. In its first year, `r dcgsum['n']` creators were awarded `r dcgsum['total']` in project funding.
