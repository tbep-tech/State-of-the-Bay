# Informed, Engaged, Responsible Community

## Behavior Change 

Pipe Up! is TBEPâ€™s latest community-based social marketing campaign, aimed at encouraging homeowners and home buyers to inspect, repair or replace aging private lateral sewer lines to prevent sanitary sewer overflows into Tampa Bay and its watershed. 

TBEP keeps the "Scoop the Poop!" campaign alive by making outreach materials available to pet owners and interested campaign ambassadors upon request.

Each summer, TBEP encourages residents to "protect their fun" as part of the Be Floridian campaign. Through inbound marketing tactics, the Program works to increase awareness of regional fertilizer ordinances and share tips for individuals to reduce their nutrient footprint.

## Give-a-Day for the Bay

## Grants Awarded

To date, TBERF has received $8.0M in funding + $13.3M in matching funds to support 80 grants within the Tampa Bay watershed.

Since 2000, sales from the Tarpon Tag speciality license plate have collectively awarded $2M to more than 370 community-based restoration projects in the bay through TBEP's Bay Mini-Grant program

Established during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Digital Challenge Grant program was created to provide income opportunities for digital content creators, science communicators, graphic designers and educators.

## Reach Index

Being heard in an increasingly busy digital landscape is harder now than ever before. To elevate its message and the work of its partners, TBEP leans on social networking platforms to reach new audiences and maintain meaningful communication with its current online community. Through engagement-driven messaging, innovative mediums and frequent adaptation, the Program hopes to increase its volume, distribute important media and elevate the voices of its partners.
