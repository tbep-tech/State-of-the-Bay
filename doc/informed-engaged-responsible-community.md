# Informed, Engaged, Responsible Community

## Behavior Change 

Pipe Up! is TBEPâ€™s latest community-based social marketing campaign, aimed at encouraging homeowners and home buyers to inspect, repair, or replace aging private lateral sewer lines to prevent sanitary sewer overflows into Tampa Bay and its watershed.

#LoveTampaBay is a hashtag campaign supported by folks that live, work and play in Tampa Bay, with over 7k posts on Instagram. The cinematic & serene content produced by members of this digital community feeds TBEP's "Life in the Bay" video series. 

TBEP keeps the "Scoop that Poop!" campaign alive by making outreach materials available to pet owners and interested campaign ambassadors upon request.

Each summer, TBEP encourages residents to "protect their fun" as part of the Be Floridian campaign. Through inbound marketing tactics, the Program works to increase awareness of regional fertilizer ordinances, shares tips for individuals to reduce their nutrient footprint and encourages Florida-Friendly Landscaping practices.

## Give-a-Day for the Bay

Community involvement has been at the center of Tampa Bay's recovery story since the start. Keeping that tradition alive is the Give-a-Day for the Bay volunteer program where community members put in "sweat equity" to protect and restore bay-area parks and preserves. From planting native vegetation to removing trash from a mangrove island, these events encourage the community to get out, give back, and enjoy the bay!

Since 2019, there have been 28 Give-A-Day for the Bay volunteer workdays co-hosted with 37 bay-area partners. During this time, significant attention has been given to addressing excessive litter and native habitat degradation in regions of the watershed that have historically not received support for restoration activities. During these events, 1,500 volunteers removed 5 tons of debris and litter, planted 5,680 native plants, and moved 30 tons of oyster shells to create oyster reefs. Volunteers have also participated in citizen science projects that highlighted the importance of blue carbon habitats by using tea bags to measure soil decomposition rates and carbon storage capacities of wetlands.

## Grants Awarded

To date, TBERF has received $8.0M in funding + $13.3M in matching funds to support 80 grants within the Tampa Bay watershed.

Funded by sales from of the Tampa Bay Estuary Spelicaty License Plate, also known as the "Tarpon Tag", Bay Mini-Grants provide competative cash awards (up to $5,000) to community organizations for projects that help restore and protect Tampa Bay. To achieve Program CCMP goals, specific Bay Mini-Grant priority actions are annoucned annually. Expanding the use of green infrastructure and understanding emerging contaminants have both been recent Bay Mini-Grant priorities. Since 2000, sales from the Tarpon Tag speciality license plate have collectively awarded $2M to more than 370 community-based restoration projects in the bay through TBEP's Bay Mini-Grant program.

Established during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Digital Challenge Grant program was created to provide safer-at-home income opportunities for digital content creators, science communicators, graphic designers, and educators. In its first year, 10 creators were awarded more than $6k in project funding.

## Reach Index

Being heard in an increasingly noisey digital landscape is harder now than ever before. TBEP uses social networking platforms to reach new audiences and maintain itentional communication with the online community. Through engagement-driven messaging, innovative mediums, and adaptive tinkering, the Program amplifies its messages, makes science accessible to the general public, and elevates awareness of its partners actions.
