## How are Tampa Bay’s Natural Habitats Changing?

Prior to the 1980s, many of Tampa Bay’s habitats were damaged, reduced, or lost during development activities. Once the value of these habitats was recognized, protections were put in place and monitoring began on a regular basis to understand the effectiveness of different conservation and restoration activities.

When viewed as a whole, the most significant and meaningful trends in the TBEP habitats of interest over the periods of record examined include: 1) the 47% gain in seagrasses from 1988 to 2020; 2) the slight gains in both emergent tidal wetlands (10% gain) and freshwater wetlands (2% gain) between 1990 and 2017; and 3) the 39 percent loss in native upland habitats from 1990 to 2017. The increasing trend in seagrass coverage is a testament to improved bay water quality.

While some recent gains in seagrass coverage have been erased, the remaining seagrasses still reflect improvements in water quality over the past several decades and still serve as an important guidepost for successful restoration of those subtidal habitats.

The intertidal habitat gains demonstrate the effectiveness of publicly-funded habitat restoration projects and state and federal wetland regulatory programs. Minor increases in salt barrens may also reflect a landward expansion associated with sea level rise. 

However, a loss of upland habitats is the result of continued human population growth and urban development in the Tampa Bay watershed, and unless local protections for native upland habitats improve, this trend will likely continue.

## Restoration Projects to Improve Tampa Bay’s Natural Systems

Habitat restoration is an attempt to restore important services provided by natural systems. These ecological services can include providing fish nurseries; improving water quality; reducing erosion; and storm surge protection. This can involve a variety of habitat types, from salt marshes to pine flatwoods. 

Habitat restoration in the Tampa Bay region has evolved over time from a simple planting of red mangroves west of the Howard Frankland bridge in 1971 to major landscape-scale ecosystem restoration projects such as Rock Ponds, that involved 1,043 acres of landform changes on regionally significant tracts of coastal land. Nearly 5,000 acres of habitat restoration has occurred in the Tampa Bay watershed since 1971.

Tampa Bay restoration professionals often work to create or restore a mosaic of habitats to reflect the variety seen in natural systems.

To continue the improvements that have occurred, the Habitat Master Plan (2020 Update) includes a target of restoring 3,150 acres of wetlands and uplands by 2030:

-50 acres of oyster reefs

-1,000 acres of tidal wetlands, such as salt marshes, salt barrens, and mangroves

-1,500 acres of freshwater wetlands, including freshwater marshes, wet prairies, and cypress forests

-600 acres of uplands, including coastal hammocks and pine flatwoods

## Tampa Bay Nekton Index

The nekton index, which is similar to the water quality scorecard, uses catch data from the State’s Fisheries Independent Monitoring Program (FWC - FWRI) to track trends for representative species. With samples dating back to 1989, there is a long-term record that can be related to water quality and habitat characteristics. The index groups and assesses catch data according to habitat use, species composition and diversity, and feeding dynamics to understand trends in the fish community.

An annual “snapshot” of ecological health helps fisheries managers target efforts to improve habitat or other factors, if persistently low scores below “normal” conditions are detected. While the data period does not include “pristine” conditions, the community appears to be resistant to large-scale changes and resilient to episodic disturbances over the period the index was developed. “Yellow” cautionary scores in the mid-2000s and 2010/11 coincided with red tide or cold snaps, however, the index doesn’t specifically point to these events as direct causes of declining scores. Regardless, nekton communities appear to have rebounded, with all four major bay segments receiving “green” scores the past four years.

Action: Continue monitoring nekton health annually and incorporate the index into habitat restoration planning.
