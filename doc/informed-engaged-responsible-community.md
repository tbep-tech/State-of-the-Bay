# Informed, Engaged, Responsible Community

## Behavior Change 

Pipe Up! is TBEPâ€™s latest community-based social marketing campaign, aimed at encouraging homeowners and home buyers to inspect, repair, or replace aging private lateral sewer lines to prevent sanitary sewer overflows into Tampa Bay and its watershed. 

TBEP keeps the "Scoop the Poop!" campaign alive by making outreach materials available to pet owners and interested campaign ambassadors upon request.

Each summer, TBEP encourages residents to "protect their fun" as part of the Be Floridian campaign. Through inbound marketing tactics, the Program works to increase awareness of regional fertilizer ordinances and share tips for individuals to reduce their nutrient footprint.

## Give-a-Day for the Bay

Community involvement has been at the center of Tampa Bay's recovery story since the start. Keeping that tradition alive is the Give-a-Day for the Bay volunteer program where community members put in "sweat equity" to protect and restore parks and preserves around the bay area. From planting native vegetation to recmoving trash from a mangrove island, these events encourage the community to get out, give back, and enjoy the bay!

Since 2019, there have been 28 Give-A-Day for the Bay volunteer events co-hosted with 37 bay-area partners. These events began to address excessive litter and native habitat degradation in regions of that watershed that have historically not received support for restoration activities. During these Give-A-Day for the Bay events, 1,500 volunteers have removed 5 tons of debris and litter, planted 5,680 native plants, and moved 30 tons of oyster shells to create an oyster reef. Volunteers have also participated in citizen science projects that highlighted the importance of blue carbon habitats by using tea bags to measure soil decomposition rates and carbon storage capacities of wetlands.

## Grants Awarded

To date, TBERF has received $8.0M in funding + $13.3M in matching funds to support 80 grants within the Tampa Bay watershed.

Since 2000, sales from the Tarpon Tag speciality license plate have collectively awarded $2M to more than 370 community-based restoration projects in the bay through TBEP's Bay Mini-Grant program

Established during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Digital Challenge Grant program was created to provide income opportunities for digital content creators, science communicators, graphic designers, and educators.

## Reach Index

Being heard in an increasingly busy digital landscape is harder now than ever before. To elevate its message and the work of its partners, TBEP leans on social networking platforms to reach new audiences and maintain meaningful communication with its current online community. Through engagement-driven messaging, innovative mediums and frequent adaptation, the Program hopes to increase its volume, distribute important media and elevate the voices of its partners.
